<center><u><h3>Is Viggo Grimborn,the antagonist with the most character development?</u></h3>
<br>
<p>Viggo,first introduced in Season 2 Episode 12,is argueably the best antagonist in How To Train Your Dragon.This is not because he was the most powerful antagonist(that is a debate <br>
between Drago and Grimmel) but he was the most human.He wasn't yelling all the time like Drago or Dagur and he wasn't showing off all the time like Grimmel.He had respect and in <br>
cases,even admiration for Hiccup.</bod>

When we first hear about Viggo,we never actually see him and he is portrayed as a far greater threat than anything we have seen before.This was done by Dreamworks as the viewer wonders what<br> 
kind of enemy we are about to see.When we first see Viggo,he immediately comes off as smarter and slimer than the rest of the previous antagonists as Alvin,Dagur and Ryker usually surpassed <br>
Hiccup and the gang in terms of physical strength so we get the impression that this villian is smarter than Hiccup.His Relationship with his brother is also a key part of his character.   <br>
Ryker,throughout the season, was portrayed as someone intimidating and powerful however when he see him mocked and treated with such little respect.It creates an image of Viggo as someone  <br>
who doesn't need strength but can win agauinst anyone with his own intellilect.He also taps his brother on the shoulder and says"What fun would a game be if saddled with with an inferior opponent."<br>
after Hiccup gets through the Typhoomerangs.It is clear that Viggo views Hiccup as his inferior and views his match with Hicupp as another game.However,this changes considerably,later on in the <br>
